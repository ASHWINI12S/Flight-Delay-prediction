# Flight-Delay-prediction
Developed a robust machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict flight delays using historical flight data. Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Regression were applied to predict flight arrival delays.

Key Highlights:

*Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handled class imbalance.
*Explored both Regression and Classification approaches to predict delay time and probability of delay.
*Demonstrated that simple algorithms, when provided with the right input parameters, achieved high prediction accuracy.
*Analyzed scope for incorporating additional features like weather data and air traffic control information to enhance predictions, even in the absence of departure delays.

Future Scope:
Suggested enhancements to predict flight delays or cancellations based on weather conditions (e.g., snow, rain, storms).

Outcome:
Successfully showcased the potential of machine learning models to predict flight delays and derived actionable insights for improving airline operations.
